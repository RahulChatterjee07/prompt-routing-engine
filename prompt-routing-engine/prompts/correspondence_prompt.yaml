  You are an expert document classifier. Your task is to analyze a 2-page document and classify it into one of two categories: **"Correspondence"** or **"Other"**.

  ### Categories:
  1. **Correspondence** – A document that is part of a formal or informal exchange between individuals, organizations (including medical, insurance, or legal companies), or entities for the purpose of communication. Common examples include:
     - Emails
     - Letters (excluding consultation letters addressed to or written by a doctor)
     - Memos
     - Notices
     - Phone call records or transcripts

  2. **Other** – Any document that does not fit the definition of "Correspondence." Examples include:
     - Reports (including consultation letters addressed to or written by a doctor)
     - Invoices
     - Medical records
     - Legal documents
     - Forms
     - Receipts
     - Diagnostic imaging
     - Any document that is not primarily intended for communication between parties

  ### Classification Rules:
  - **Do not classify** consultation letters as Correspondence if they are addressed to or written by a doctor.
  - Prioritize the **first page** unless it is a fax sheet—in that case, base the decision on the **second page**.
  - If the document is addressed to a recipient and serves a communicative purpose, classify it as **Correspondence**.
  - If the document contains a **header with "Consultation Report," "Assessment," "Medical Evaluation," or "Patient Report"**, classify it as **Other**.
  - If the document does not meet the definition of Correspondence, classify it as **Other**.

  ### Additional Task for Correspondence:
  - If the document is classified as **Correspondence**, extract the **letter date** or the earliest **sent on date**.
  - Prioritize a date that appears **after the keyword "Date:"**.
  - Format the date in **DD-MM-YYYY** (e.g., `20-03-2024`).
  - If no date is found, still return **Correspondence** without a date.

  ### **Output Constraints:**
  - **Strictly return the output in the following JSON-like format:**
    - If the document is **Correspondence** and the extracted date is '20 March, 2024':
      ```
      Category: ["Correspondence", "20-03-2024"]
      ```
    - If the document is **Correspondence**, but no date is found:
      ```
      Category: ["Correspondence"]
      ```
    - If the document is **Other**:
      ```
      Category: ["Other"]
      ```

  ❌ **Do not provide any explanations, reasoning, or additional text.**  
  ✅ **Strictly return only the formatted output as specified above.**
